# They Are Billions: Early HotkeysAutoHotkey configuration for They Are Billions, the famously difficult zombie indie game.Until Numantian Games comes out with their own hotkey system, here's a third-party one for They Are Billions! (I sympathize as a developer - I know it's not trivial, especially for a custom engine!) I don't play without it!This is an [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) script. AutoHotKey is an powerful and popular open-source program to modify your controls. AutoHotKey version 1.1.05+ required.# Setup## Install autohotkey[Download link](https://autohotkey.com/download/)## Customize the scriptYou need to edit the script for your screen size. (Mine is a 2048x1152 monitor, so if that's what you use, you can keep the default values.)1. Take a screenshot of They Are Billions2. Open your screenshot in Microsoft Paint3. Get the coordinates of the _top-left_ and _bottom-right_ pixels of the 5x3 grid of buttons (right on the edge of the clickable area)4. Set x_min and y_min to the top-left corner and x_max and y_max to the top-right corner![Screenshot of mspaint showing a) the corners and b) where to read their pixel value](grid_corner_diagram.png)# UsageWith AutoHotKey installed, just double click on the .ahk file! Depending on your operating system, you might instead have to Run as Administrator. Right click on the .ahk file and select Run as Administrator.(If you are leery of giving some software from the internet admin access, well, good for you! You should be leery! However, AutoHotKey has been out for a long time, is quite popular, and most importantly, is open-source. These combined mean that there has been plenty of time for people to judge the reliability and catch security issues while looking over the code.)I took away your in-game menu! If you need it, here's how to stop the hotkey script. Alt-Tab to windows and right click the green H icon. _Exit_ will close the hotkey script. _Suspend Hotkeys_ will temporarily disable it, to e.g. let you change settings or use a different program while Alt-Tabbed.# Hotkey reference[Hotkey reference guide](hotkey_reference.md).All buildings are laid down with a sequence of three keys. They will be of the form B-X-Y, where:- B is for Build- X is the menu hotkey (matches in-game tooltip)- Y is that building's hotkey. See the hotkey reference guide.ESC returns to the command center menu. (I wanted it to also function as "cancel", but that's trickier to implement.)## Relation to StarcraftHotkeys are heavily inspired by Starcraft 1 and 2. This means that:0) B for build (selects the command center)2) Hotkeys come from the name of the building3) Keys on the left-hand are preferred; thus letters can come from the middle of a word4) They sometimes use the Starcraft building name - e.g. B (Barracks) for Soldier CenterIf, after reading that explanation, some of hotkeys seem strange to you, know that some of my choices are based on the limitations of the hacky method I used to create a context-sensitive hotkey system in a couple evenings.# LimitationsThe big thing you should be aware of is that this script has ZERO access to They Are Billions. All it knows are the keys you press. I'm doing the best I can! I ironed out all-the game-breaking issues and we're left with these. Until I can fix them, here are some workarounds.Sometimes you can get in a weird state where this script thinks you're in a different menu and thus doesn't do what you expect it to. _If the hotkeys are acting up, hit ESC omce!_ This will tell the script you're back at the command center menu.You will see your cursor move. This is a side-effect of the clicking method I used to implement the hotkeys. Sometimes - e.g. final horde lag, your [APM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actions_per_minute) is too fast ;-) - the cursor won't make it all the way to the button before the mouse clicks. I could increase the delay to prevent this, but I'd rather have a fast UI. (That's why I made these hotkeys in the first place!) _If the cursor misses, either a) hit the final button in the sequence again or b) hit ESC and redo the sequence._This script doesn't know about control groups! So if you exit a build menu by hitting, e.g. "1" to select your archers on control group one, the script will still think you're in a building menu and attack move will do something weird. _When selecting units after building, hit ESC once._ Finding a way to deal with this is my first priority right now.# LicenseGPLv3+ for everybody except Numantian Games, who can do WTF they want with this code! <3
